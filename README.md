# Huffman-Encoding
Huffman encoding is a way to assign binary codes to symbols that reduces the overall number of bits used to encode a string with those symbols. In many applications, the symbols are usually just a languages alphabet. In this project the english alphabet is used for a total of 24 possible symbol occurrences
## Algorithm Steps
1. Scan file and calculate percentage odds for each alphabetical letter
2. Construct Huffman Ordered Linked List in ascending order of symbol occurrence
3. Construct the Huffman Binary Tree using the Ordered Linked List as input
4. Trace the HBT to find character (symbol) code pairs
5. Traverse the HBT in preorder method
